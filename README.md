This is the documentation for all the mods that I've done on my ender 3 over 4 years (since 2020).

## Intentions with the modifications


## Mods

1. CR-touch
2. Dual Z axis
3. Flexible PEI bed
4. Silicon Bed Spacers
5. BTT smart filament sensor
6. Bottom PSU mount
7. Tall legs
8. Inset display mount
9. BTT Manta E3EZ + CM1 Board
10. Sprite Pro Extruder
11. Spriteburner Mod (with 5010 fan)
12. Bimetal Heatbreak
13. Hardened Steel Nozzle
14. Klipper!! (offcourse)
15. Linear X Axis Rails
16. Linear Z Axis Rails
17. BTT Eddy

## Recommended Accessories

1. Fiament Dryer
2. Crafting Knife
3. ADXL sensors

## Future plans ?

1. Webcam feed
2. Obico server
3. Linear Y axis rails ( Only if Klipper gets native support for strain gauge )
4. Load Cell based Z Offset on Hotbed (Can be based on PRtouch on Ender 3v3 se/ke )
5. ✅ BTT Eddy
6. ✅ Linear Z axis rails (actually this seem to be more important than Y axis, because Z v-slot wheels seems to loosen up due to added weight, and needs to be tightened as a regular maintenance every few months) 
7. BigTreeTech VVD (Might need to upgrade the toolhead to stealthburner)


## Mods on order of priority

### Phase 1 - Reliable Printing
1. Silicon Bed Spacers
2. BiMetal Heatbreak
3. CR-Touch

### Phase 2 - Klipper
1. BTT Manta E3EZ + CB1 Board
2. Sprite Pro Extruder

### Phase 4.1 - Extra set 01 - Quality of Life
1. BTT filament sensor
2. Filament dryer
4. Y axis linear rails (it really improves print quality, but I am waiting for linear rails compatible with load cell sensors)
5. BTT eddy

### Phase 5 - Multimaterial & Multitooling
1. Voron Stealthburner
2. Stealthburner easy tool change mod (need to design)
3. BTT VVD

### 2024 updates

- PEZ (Polyurea) build plate
- ceramic hotend
- custom nozzle wiper mount
- conditional turn off of filament sensor at layer 0-2 and turn on at layer 3
- custom cable organizer
